<h1 style="text-align:center"> Hello World, The Future is Now </h1>

<p>I've created this GitHub Page to help grow my portfolio for collage. Right now its pretty empty. I'm working a little with @GarrettRector on some projects and creating my own projects in Python, Java, Arduino C, HTML, Node.JS, NW.js, and more. Its all just a learning experience.</p>

<p> I'm using PyCharm (Python) for most of these projects and personally use a bunch of the work here on my homebuilt server.</p>
