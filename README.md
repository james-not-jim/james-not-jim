<h1 style="text-align:center"> Hello World, The Future is Now </h1>

<p>I've created this GitHub Page to help grow my portfolio for collage. Right now its pretty empty. I'm working a little with @GarrettRector on some projects and creating my own projects in Python, Java, Arduino C, HTML, Node.JS, NW.js, and more. Its all just a learning experience.</p>

<p> A lot of these are just basic programs to make my life easier at school.</p>

<p> If you want to run any of the python projects don't worry about dependancies, pip, conda, or even having python installed. I will do my best to keep programs packed with pyinstaller and avalible as .exe programs as well as source code avalible. </p>
