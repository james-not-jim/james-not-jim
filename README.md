 # Hello World, The Future is Now

I've created this GitHub Page to help grow my portfolio for collage. Right now its pretty empty. I am working with [@DavidKDodita](https://www.github.com/DavidKDodita) on our Saharan Echo Reasearch project and creating my own little projects in Python, Java, Arduino C, HTML, Node.JS, NW.js, and more. Its all just a learning experience.

A lot of these are just basic programs to make my life easier at school.

If you want to run any of the python projects don't worry about dependancies, pip, conda, or even having python installed. I will do my best to keep programs packed with pyinstaller and avalible as .exe programs as well as source code avalible.
